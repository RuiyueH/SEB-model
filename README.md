# SEB-model

## Overview

This repository contains code for a simple land surface model. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks for the forward/inverse models, output files, and code and figures for visualising results. Below is a summary of the contents:

### Forward model/
- **Forward_SEB_model.ipynb**: This file contains code for the forward model. It solves for temperature profiles in the soil over time, given known physical parameters and boundary conditions. 
- **Output files**: This file contains synthetic temperature data at specified depths are saved as text files (e.g., `Target_T1.txt`, `Target_T2.txt`) for use in inverse modeling.

### Inverse model_Synthetic data/
- **Inverse_SEB_model_Synthetic_data_1depth.ipynb**: This file performs inverse modelling to estimate input parameters from synthetic temperature data at a single depth. It uses backpropagation to fit input parameters so that the simulated temperature matches the synthetic data. 
- **Inverse_SEB_model_Synthetic_data_2depths.ipynb**: This file is similar to the single-depth inverse model, except it uses synthetic temperature data from two depths for improved parameter estimation.
- **Output files**: These files contain the final parameter values from optimisation runs (e.g., `final_parameter_values_*.txt`).
- **Synthetic data_graphs.ipynb**: This file contains code to generate figures based on the results obtained from the inverse models. 

### Inverse model_West Phoenix/
- **Inverse_SEB_model_WestPhoenix.ipynb**: The file applies the inverse modelling approach to flux tower data from West Phoenix, US. 
- **Output files**: These files contain the final parameter values from optimisation runs (e.g., `final_parameter_values_WP_T5T15_*.txt`).
- **West Phoenix_graphs.ipynb**: This file contains code to generate figures based on the results obtained from the West Phoenix inverse model.
